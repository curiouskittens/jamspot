### What Is Jamspot? :large_blue_circle:

There's nothing like playing live music with others who share your passion. Whether you're a newbie or a pro, Jamspot helps you find the coolest musicians around.

Join a Jam to meet new friends, play some tunes and create the next musical masterpiece!

### Creating an Account :wave:

Click on the "Sign Up" or "Let's Jam" buttons on the Jamspot landing page.

Fill out your name, email, username and password (of at least six characters). Hit "Sign Up," and you're good to go!

### Logging In :white_check_mark:

Click on the "Log In" button on the Jamspot landing page.

Correctly enter your username and password. Hit "Log In," and you're good to go!

### Your Home Page :house:

This page gives you an overview of everything that's happening on Jamspot.

You have easy access to your next upcoming Jam and your most recent past Jam. The sidebar profile is a quick reminder of what instruments and genres you've publicized, and the Open Jams carousel at the bottom allows you to easily scroll through the Jams currently posted on Jamspot.

### Your Profile :raising_hand:

This page contains information about you and will be viewable (but not editable) by other Jamspot users.

Your profile image is pulled from Gravatar, the free globally recognized avatar service. You can add a bio, the instruments you play (and how skilled you are at them), and your favorite genres. This will help you connect with the right musicians!

Don't forget hook up your Soundcloud account so others can get a sneak peek of your talent! 

### Creating a Jam :guitar:

Head to the "Create a Jam" page to create your own posting.

You will need to fill out a name, description, date and time, location, instruments and number of players needed, and genres. Once all that information is squared away, hit "Create Jam," and your Jam will be live for others to find.

### Finding a Jam :mag:

Click on "Find a Jam" to see all open Jams on Jamspot, as well as Jams you've already requested to join.

By default, you'll see the Jam's creator, date and time, and location. Click on "More Info" on a Jam card to see that Jam's description, instruments and genres.

### Joining a Jam :dancers:

If you like what you see on a Jam card, hit the "Join Jam" button to send a request to the admin of that Jam. Once the admin receives your join request, they'll be able to view your profile and choose to accept or decline your request.

Likewise, you'll be able to accept or decline anyone who requests to join your Jams.

### Your Jams :notes:

The "My Jams" page shows all the Jams that you are a part of, both past and present. If you're the admin of a Jam, it will be marked with a gold star! :star:

### The Jam Page :metal:

Each Jam comes with its own individual page, accessible by clicking the "See Jam" button on one of your Jams. These pages are visible only to members of that Jam, making them a great place to get to know each other, chat and collaborate!

Use the Post feature to share ideas beforehand, communicate when it's time to meet up, and recap what went well afterward. Jam pages are accessible even after the Jam is over, so you won't lose touch with your newfound musical friends!
